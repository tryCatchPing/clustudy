# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the current memory-based repository implementations to IsarDB, a high-performance NoSQL database for Flutter applications. The migration will replace all existing memory repositories (MemoryVaultTreeRepository, MemoryLinkRepository, MemoryNotesRepository) with Isar-based implementations while maintaining the same interface contracts and improving data persistence, performance, and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from memory-based data storage to IsarDB, so that the application can persist data across app restarts and provide better performance for large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL initialize IsarDB with proper schema definitions
2. WHEN data is written to any repository THEN the system SHALL persist the data to IsarDB storage
3. WHEN the app restarts THEN the system SHALL restore all previously saved data from IsarDB
4. WHEN repository operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interface contracts as the current memory implementations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing data models to be compatible with IsarDB, so that the migration can be seamless without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are defined THEN the system SHALL add appropriate Isar annotations (@collection, @Id, @Index)
2. WHEN models contain relationships THEN the system SHALL use IsarLinks for proper relationship management
3. WHEN models are serialized/deserialized THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing JSON serialization
4. WHEN nullable fields exist THEN the system SHALL handle them properly in Isar schema

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database transaction layer to be updated for IsarDB, so that write operations are properly wrapped in Isar transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN write operations are performed THEN the system SHALL wrap them in Isar write transactions
2. WHEN multiple operations need atomicity THEN the system SHALL support transaction boundaries
3. WHEN transaction errors occur THEN the system SHALL properly handle rollbacks
4. WHEN read operations are performed THEN the system SHALL not require transaction wrapping

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all repository implementations to be replaced with Isar-based versions, so that data persistence works correctly across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VaultTreeRepository operations are called THEN the system SHALL use IsarVaultTreeRepository implementation
2. WHEN LinkRepository operations are called THEN the system SHALL use IsarLinkRepository implementation
3. WHEN NotesRepository operations are called THEN the system SHALL use IsarNotesRepository implementation
4. WHEN repository streams are watched THEN the system SHALL emit updates when underlying Isar data changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to optimize database operations where possible, so that performance is improved over the memory-based approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries are performed THEN the system SHALL use Isar's efficient indexing and query capabilities
2. WHEN relationships are accessed THEN the system SHALL use IsarLinks for optimized relationship queries
3. WHEN bulk operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use Isar's batch operations
4. WHEN data is filtered or sorted THEN the system SHALL leverage Isar's built-in query optimization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and migration support, so that the transition to IsarDB is smooth and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
2. WHEN schema migrations are needed THEN the system SHALL handle version upgrades gracefully
3. WHEN data corruption occurs THEN the system SHALL provide recovery mechanisms
4. WHEN development/testing is performed THEN the system SHALL support database reset and cleanup operations
