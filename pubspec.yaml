# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# - 마이너(x.1.x): 호환성 유지하면서 의미 있는 기능 추가나 UX 개선이 있을 때. 기존 사용 흐름은 유지되지만 “새 기능”이라 말할 수 있는 수준
# - 패치(x.x.1): 버그 수정, 안정화, 성능 조정처럼 기존 기능을 깨지 않고 다듬을 때. 핫픽스
# - 빌드 번호(+n): 같은 앱 버전을 여러 번 스토어에 제출할 때
