## Architecture Overview

This is a Flutter-based handwriting note app built with a **feature-driven architecture** using **GoRouter** for navigation. The codebase has been recently refactored with a clean modular structure.

### Core Architecture Pattern

**Clean Feature Architecture:**

- **Features** (`lib/features/`): Self-contained modules for major functionality
- **Shared** (`lib/shared/`): Common utilities, services, and app-wide components
- **GoRouter-based navigation**: Centralized routing with feature-specific route definitions

### Feature Structure

Each feature follows a consistent structure:

```
lib/features/[feature_name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/     # Feature-specific constants
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/   # Business logic and state management
â”œâ”€â”€ mixins/        # Reusable behavior mixins
â”œâ”€â”€ models/        # Data models
â”œâ”€â”€ notifiers/     # Custom notifiers and state providers
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/         # Screen/page widgets
â”œâ”€â”€ routing/       # Feature-specific routes
â””â”€â”€ widgets/       # UI components
    â”œâ”€â”€ controls/  # Control widgets
    â””â”€â”€ toolbar/   # Toolbar components
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Canvas System (`lib/features/canvas/`)

**Primary drawing and note editing functionality:**

- **Controllers**: `note_editor_controller.dart` manages drawing state and tool selection (currently commented for Provider migration)
- **Mixins**: `auto_save_mixin.dart` and `tool_management_mixin.dart` for cross-cutting concerns
- **Notifiers**:
  - `custom_scribble_notifier.dart`: Custom Scribble notifier with scaleFactor fixed at 1.0 for consistent stroke width across zoom levels
  - `scribble_notifier_x.dart`: Extended functionality for Scribble integration
- **Comprehensive UI**: Modular toolbar system with separate components for colors, strokes, tools, and actions
- **Controls**: Pressure sensitivity, pointer mode, and viewport information widgets
- **Background Widget**: `canvas_background_widget.dart` with simplified 2-tier file-based loading system
- **Error Recovery**: `file_recovery_modal.dart` provides user-friendly file corruption recovery options

#### 2. Note Management (`lib/features/notes/`)

**Note organization and listing:**

- **Models**:
  - `note_model.dart`: Core note structure with PDF metadata support
  - `note_page_model.dart`: Individual page model with file-based storage (memory cache removed for performance)
- **Data**: `fake_notes.dart` provides development data (temporary, will be replaced with Isar DB)
- **Pages**: `note_list_screen.dart` for note browsing and PDF import functionality

#### 3. Home (`lib/features/home/`)

**Main navigation and entry point:**

- **Pages**: `home_screen.dart` as the main landing page
- **Routing**: Centralized home navigation

#### 4. Shared Infrastructure (`lib/shared/`)

**App-wide utilities and components:**

- **Routing**: `app_routes.dart` defines all route constants and type-safe navigation helpers
- **Services**:
  - `file_picker_service.dart` for file operations
  - `file_storage_service.dart` for internal file management and PDF storage
  - `pdf_note_service.dart` for PDF-to-note conversion with file copying (legacy memory cache methods deprecated)
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components like headers, cards, and navigation elements

### Navigation Architecture

**GoRouter-based routing** with feature separation:

- **Main router** (`lib/main.dart`): Combines routes from all features
- **Feature routes**: Each feature manages its own routes
- **Type-safe navigation**: `AppRoutes` class provides route constants and helper methods

### External Dependencies

- **Scribble**: Custom GitHub fork (main branch) for Apple Pencil pressure support
- **go_router**: v16.0.0 for declarative navigation
- **pdfx**: v2.5.0 for PDF viewing and interaction
- **file_picker**: v8.0.6 for file selection
- **path_provider**: v2.1.4 for app document directory access
- **path**: v1.9.0 for file path manipulation

### Development Standards

- **Dart SDK**: 3.8.1+ required
- **Strict linting**: Comprehensive analysis rules for code quality
- **Code style**: Single quotes, const constructors, final locals enforced
- **Documentation**: Public API documentation required (`public_member_api_docs: true`)
- **Import organization**: Relative imports preferred, directives ordering enforced

## Common Development Workflows

### Adding New Canvas Features

1. **Controllers**: Check existing controller patterns in `lib/features/canvas/controllers/`
2. **Mixins**: Use mixins for cross-cutting concerns (auto-save, tool management)
3. **Notifiers**: Extend existing custom notifiers for drawing behavior
   - **Important**: `CustomScribbleNotifier` overrides private methods from Scribble package
   - **scaleFactor Management**: Always use `setScaleFactor(1.0)` for consistent stroke width across zoom levels
   - Copy private methods when needed, add detailed source comments
4. **UI Components**: Add widgets to appropriate subdirectories (controls/, toolbar/)
5. **Constants**: Define feature constants in `note_editor_constant.dart`
6. **Performance**: Consider debouncing for real-time updates (8ms recommended for 120fps)

### Working with Navigation

1. **Route Definition**: Add routes to feature-specific routing files
2. **Route Constants**: Define paths in `lib/shared/routing/app_routes.dart`
3. **Type-safe Navigation**: Use helper methods from `AppRoutes` class
4. **Main Router**: Routes are automatically included from feature route lists

### Adding New Features

1. **Create Feature Structure**: Follow the established pattern under `lib/features/[feature_name]/`
2. **Feature Routes**: Create routing file following existing patterns
3. **Register Routes**: Add feature routes to main router in `lib/main.dart`
4. **Shared Resources**: Add any shared components to `lib/shared/`

### Working with PDF Features

**ðŸš€ Service-Centered PDF Management System (Major Update v2.2):**

#### **Complete PDF Workflow - From Import to Recovery**

**ðŸ”„ Import & Creation Flow:**
1. **File Selection**: User selects PDF from local storage (with validation)
2. **Metadata Extraction**: PDF properties (pages, size, title) extracted
3. **Original Storage**: PDF copied to app internal storage (`/notes/{noteId}/original.pdf`)
4. **Image Rendering**: Each page rendered to PNG with progress tracking
5. **File Storage**: Images saved as `page_1.png`, `page_2.png`, etc.
6. **Note Creation**: `NoteModel` created with PDF metadata
7. **List Update**: Note added to user's note collection

**ðŸ“± Usage & Display Flow:**
8. **Note Opening**: User selects note from list â†’ Editor opens
9. **Image Loading**: Pre-rendered images loaded for canvas background
10. **Error Detection**: Missing/corrupted image files detected automatically

**ðŸ”§ Recovery & Management Flow:**
11. **Recovery Modal**: User presented with clear options:
    - **Re-render**: Generate new images from original PDF
    - **Sketch Only**: Remove PDF background, keep user drawings
    - **Delete Note**: Remove entire note and files
12. **Re-rendering**: Original PDF â†’ New images (preserves user sketches)
13. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress with cancellation support
14. **Fallback Handling**: PDF missing â†’ Clear user notification
15. **Note Deletion**: Complete directory removal + database cleanup

#### **File Structure & Management**

```
/Application Documents/notes/
â”œâ”€â”€ {noteId}/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ original.pdf          # Original PDF file (for re-rendering)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json         # PDF metadata (pages, dimensions, title)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page_1.png           # Pre-rendered page images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page_2.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page_N.png
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sketches.json        # User drawing data (preserved during recovery)
```

#### **Service Architecture**

**Centralized PDF Management**: All PDF operations handled by `PdfManager` service:
- `importPdfNote()`: Complete import flow with progress tracking
- `loadPageImage()`: Intelligent image loading with error detection
- `recoverNote()`: Re-rendering from original PDF
- `deleteNote()`: Clean removal of all associated files

#### **Error Handling Strategy**

**Recovery Scenarios Covered:**
- **Image Corruption**: Re-render from original PDF
- **PDF Missing**: Convert to sketch-only note or delete
- **Storage Issues**: Clear error messages and fallback options
- **Memory Limits**: Efficient rendering with memory monitoring
- **User Cancellation**: Safe interruption of long operations

#### **Performance Features**

- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback for long operations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Stream-based processing for large PDFs
- **Cancellation Support**: User can interrupt rendering
- **Quality Settings**: Configurable rendering quality vs speed
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking UI during operations

## Testing Strategy

- Widget tests configured in `test/` directory
- Use `fvm flutter test` to run all tests
- Focus testing on canvas functionality and PDF integration as core features

## State Management Transition

**Note**: The project is transitioning to Provider for state management:

- Current controllers are commented for Provider migration
- Mixins provide reusable state management patterns
- Custom notifiers extend Scribble functionality

**Team Division:**
- **Main Developer**: Provider migration, PDF Manager service, Graph view system
- **Secondary Developer**: Link functionality, Isar DB integration
- **Designers**: UI component creation, design system, code conversion assistance

**Current Phase**: Week 1 - Provider state management migration and PDF Manager architecture design.

**Development Philosophy**: Focus on core functionality first (weeks 1-4), then design integration and polish (weeks 5-6).

## Development Guidelines

### Error Handling Philosophy

- **Transparency over Automation**: Let users know what's happening instead of silent fallbacks
- **User Control**: Provide clear options (re-render, delete) rather than automatic recovery
- **Predictable Behavior**: Simple 2-tier systems over complex multi-tier fallbacks

### Performance Priorities

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Avoid in-memory caching for large files
2. **Loading Predictability**: Consistent file-based loading over variable fallback times
3. **Code Simplicity**: Maintainable logic over feature complexity

### Code Review Focus Areas

- **Canvas scaling logic**: Ensure scaleFactor remains 1.0 for stroke consistency
- **File-based operations**: Verify all PDF operations use FileStorageService
- **Error boundaries**: Check that error states provide clear user feedback
- **Memory management**: Avoid storing large data structures in memory
